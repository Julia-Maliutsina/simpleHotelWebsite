<h3>IN A NUTSHELL ABOUT US</h3>
<div  class="INFOABOUT">
<h4>BUSINESS AND FAMILY FRIENDLY LODGING IN THE EAST BAY</h4>
<img src="img/hotelview.jpg"><p style="display: inline;">The Simple Hotel is celebrated today for its timeless elegance and historical prestige. But while the building is now a splendid historic hotel, it originally started life as a bank facility called the Financial Center Building. Raised in 1926, the location was designed by reputed local architect Frederick H. Meyer. The structure quickly became one of the most important monetary institutions in downtown San Francisco when it finally debuted, going on to host all sorts of banks and financial businesses for the remainder of the century. Simple Hotel eventually bought the Financial Center Building in 1956, investing millions to convert it into a luxurious hotel. The building has since gone on to become one of San Franciscoâ€™s most cherished holiday destinations, receiving numerous accolades for its unrivaled hospitality. Several prestigious travel publications have identified the Simple San Francisco Hotel as one of the most fantastic places to visit in California.</p>

    <div id="review_descr2" class="DESCR">It was a really well located area near the shopping centre and business centre. Bed was soft, towels soft, housekeepers were nice. Highly recommended for families and business people.</div>
